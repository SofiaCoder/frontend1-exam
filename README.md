# ARCHIVE OF DANCERS  
  
> This code is developed for the ability to handle an archive of dancers to make it easier for choreographers, producers, director and others to find the type of dancers they need for upcoming projects. By choosing the criterias down below you get the dancers matching your choises. You can also get all the dancers by just choosing "All" in respective tabs.

>For some proffessions in the showbiz there is a lot of dancers to consider when choosing who to send to which job. With a code like this we can easily pick out the group of dancers that would fit for a specific job.
>For example there could be an artist asking for two male dancers of a specific height to match the artists specific vision of the musicvideo. With this form you can put in those values to get the dancers that matches those criterias.
>There could also be choreographers that want dancers with a certain haircolor to a project or dancers of a certain age. There is all kinds of visions to be considered but here it is possible for some of those visions to easily be fulfilled by finding the right kind of dancer/dancers.

>This code is built on a json-file with a bunch of different dancers and information about each one of them. An HTML-file builds up the structure of the page and has both a CSS- and a Javascript-file linked to it. The js-file takes all of the registered dancers from the json-file and takes out the different dancers that matches the criterias chosen by the user in the form on the page.

## THE PROJECT INCLUDES:  
 
 >   - A json-file with all the dancers and their information saved as objects in an array with the name "users". 
 >   - A HTML-file with the structure of the page, including the form that we use to choose our propertys that will give you the dancers that matches your criterias.
 >   - A css-file for the style of the page in the browser.
 >   - A javascript-file that manages the json-data along with the options made in the browser. 
 >   - A map with images.


## TO RUN THE PROJECT:  

>   1. Add all the above files in one map, also make sure you got the additional map "img" (in your project-map).
>   2. Open the file sofia.html in a browser.
>   3. Now you can choose the criterias of the dancers you want by clicking your choises in the option-menu and then press search.
>   4. For full information of the dancers you've chosen, press "More information".
>   5. To clear your results, press the "clear"-button.  


## WHO WILL HAVE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROJECT  

> With this code you can get all kinds of different archives of persons or things. You can change the different form-values in the html-file and do the same in the javascript-file.  
> Lets say you have an archive of different computer models. With this code you can sort out different models depending on what you need or want. 
> Companies like hemnet, kÃ¶ket.se, H&M, different dejtingsites could have use of this code.  

## FEAUTURE 

> For feature work with this code I would add videos with each dancers showreel, and pictures when asking for more information. I would also add different special skills of each dancer and of course make the page better looking.
